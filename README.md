# agarclone

Play the live game at http://bigball.netlify.com/

Hello! 

This is a project that aims to clone (or get close enough) the game "www.agar.io".</br>
I have started this project with the sole purpose of developing my skills on HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.
Hopefully after a few little projects like this one, I will be able to execute an original idea and have my own game to show off!
